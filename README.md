**⚠️ Notice ⚠️**: not all my projects/contributions are listed here! I'm actually trying to move away from GitHub, at least for new stuff.

You can find more of my projects at:

* https://fgaz.me/projects
* https://sr.ht/~fgaz/
* https://codeberg.org/fgaz

...and more of my contributions may be indexed at [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/accounts/fgaz)
